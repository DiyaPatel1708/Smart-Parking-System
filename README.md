# Smart Parking System 

This project is a **Smart Parking System implemented in C++**.  
It simulates a real-world parking management system with features like spot reservation, dynamic pricing, user records, and revenue tracking.  

##  Features
- **User Management**: Store user details (name, contact, email, vehicle type, entry time).
- **Parking Spots**: Different types (Standard, Premium, EV charging, Motorcycle, Disabled).
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Parking rates vary based on occupancy and vehicle type.
- **Payment System**: Supports multiple payment modes (Cash, Card, UPI).
- **File Handling**: User information saved to a file.
- **Friend Functions**: Used to access private user and spot details.
- **Function Overloading**: Demonstrated in `Payment::pay`.
- **Default Arguments**: Used in constructors and functions to simplify usage.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Objects created with `new/delete`.

##  Concepts Implemented
- Default Arguments  
- Dynamic Memory Allocation  
- Friend Functions  
- Function Overloading  
- Enums and Classes  
- File Handling  
- Static Members  

##  File Structure
- `sps_1.cpp` → Main project source code  
- `users.txt` → Stores user data (created at runtime)
